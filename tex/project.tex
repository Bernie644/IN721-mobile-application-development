\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this assessment, you will develop \& publish a travelling application using \textbf{Kotlin} in \textbf{Android Studio} \& \textbf{Google Play Store}. \textbf{Android} feature such as \textbf{ViewModel}, \textbf{LiveData}, \textbf{Room Databasse} \& \textbf{Google Maps} were formally covered in the teaching sessions. The main purpose of this assessment is not just to build a mobile application, rather to demonstrate your ability to effectively learn intermediate/advanced Android features independently. In addition, marks will be allocated for application robustness, code elegance, documentation \& \textbf{Git/GitHub} usage.

The travelling application will help you sound like a local abroad \& help you adapt to a new culture. You will begin by selecting a continent \& country tool. For example, if you were travelling to Spain, you will have text translation \& text to speech support, a selection of key Spanish phrases \& an interactive quiz to test your knowledge of Spanish culture. A user of your travelling application must be able to select from at least two country tools excluding Antarctica.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement \& publish complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural \& code-quality standards.
	\item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario \& incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
	\item Follow industry standard software engineering practice in the design of mobile applications.
\end{enumerate}
