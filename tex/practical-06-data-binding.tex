\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this assessment, you will test the functionality of your calculator project. This assessment is worth \textbf{4\%} of the final mark in \textbf{IN721: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement \& publish complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural \& code-quality standards.
	\item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario \& incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
	\item Follow industry standard software engineering practice in the design of mobile applications.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this individual assessment inside \& outside timetabled class time. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 9 April 2021} at \textbf{5:00 PM}. 

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{IN721: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment must be completely your work \& any references must be cited appropriately including, externally-sourced graphic elements. Provide your references in a \textbf{README.md} file. All media must be royalty free (or legally purchased) for educational use. Failure to do this will result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions \& Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions \& resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submissions}
You must submit all program files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission â€“ \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/VJIq7Ae0}{https://classroom.github.com/a/VJIq7Ae0}. Checkout from the \textbf{main} branch to the \textbf{05-practical} branch by running the command - \textbf{git checkout 05-practical}. This branch will be your development branch for this assessment. Once you have completed this assessment, create a pull request \& assign the \textbf{GitHub} user \textbf{grayson-orr} to a reviewer. \textbf{Do not} merge your own pull request. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame \& usually must be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity \& achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits \& reassessments are not applicable in \textbf{IN721: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Instructions - Learning Outcomes 2, 3}
Copy your \textbf{05-practical} solution directory \& rename it \textbf{06-practical}.

\subsection*{Task One (1\%):}
Create a new activity called \textbf{SplashScreenActivity}. Use the following resource below to create an animated splash screen. \textbf{Note:} the resource uses \textbf{MainActivity} \& \textbf{activity\_main.xml}. Instead, use \textbf{SplashScreenActivity} \& \textbf{activity\_splash\_screen.xml} as \textbf{MainActivity}  is responsible for hosting your \textbf{Fragments}. Lastly, your splash screen must hide the action bar. \\

\subsection*{Task Two (1\%):}
Create a new resource directory called \textbf{anim}. Copy the \textbf{slide\_in\_right.xml} \& \textbf{slide\_out\_left.xml} file provided to you in this directory. Declare a transition between each \textbf{Fragment} using actions in the \textbf{navigation > mobile\_navigation.xml}.

\subsection*{Task Three (2\%):}
Edit your code so that it is using \textbf{Data Binding}. All functionality should be bound to you layout files.
