\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner managed time, however, there will be availability during the teaching sessions to discuss the requirements \& your progress of this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Tuesday, 9 March 2021 at 5:00 PM}. 

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{IN721: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment must be completely your work \& any references must be cited appropriately including, externally-sourced graphic elements. Provide your references in a \textbf{README.md} file. All media must be royalty free (or legally purchased) for educational use. Failure to do this will result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions \& Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions \& resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submissions}
You must submit all program files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the link to the repository you will use for your submission â€“ \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/VJIq7Ae0}{https://classroom.github.com/a/VJIq7Ae0}. Create a new branch from the \textbf{main} branch called \textbf{02-kotlin}. This branch will be your development branch for this assessment. Once you have completed this assessment, create a pull request \& assign the \textbf{GitHub} user \textbf{grayson-orr} to a reviewer. Please do not merge your own pull request. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame \& usually must be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity \& achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits \& reassessments are not applicable in \textbf{IN721: Mobile Application Development}.
