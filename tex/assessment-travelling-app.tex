\section*{Assessment Overview}
For this assessment, you will develop \& publish a travelling application using Kotlin in Android Studio \& Google Play Store. 
Intermediate Android features such as asynchronous tasks, recycler view widget, card view widget, shared preferences, SQLite \& maps were covered formally in class. The main purpose of this assessment is not just to build a mobile application, rather to demonstrate your ability to effectively learn intermediate/advanced Android features independently. In addition, marks will be allocated for application robustness, code elegance, documentation \& git usage. \\

The travelling application will help you sound like a local abroad \& help you adapt to a new culture. You begin by selecting a continent \& country tool. For example, if you are travelling to Japan, you will have text translation support, text-to-speech support, a selection of key Japanese phrases \& an interactive quiz to test your knowledge of Japanese culture. A user of your travelling application should be able to select from at least two country tools per continent \textbf{excluding} Antarctica.

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment outside timetabled class time, however, there will be availability during the teaching sessions to discuss the requirements and progress of this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by Wednesday, 14 October 2020 at 5pm. 

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced with a cumulative pass mark of 50\%.

\section*{Submission Details}
You must submit your program files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the link to the repository you will use for your submission â€“ \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/Z5yfBBUS}{https://classroom.github.com/a/Z5yfBBUS}.

\section*{Group Contribution}
All git commit messages must identify which member(s) participated in the associated work session. Proportional contribution will be determined by inspection of the commit logs. If the commit logs show evidence of significantly uneven contribution proportion, the lecturer may choose to adjust the mark of the lesser contributor downward by an amount derived from the individual contributions.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment must be completely your work and any references must be cited appropriately including, externally-sourced graphic elements. All media must be royalty free (or legally purchased) for educational use. Failure to do this will result in a mark of zero.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions \& Resits}
The school's process concerning \textbf{Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits} complies with Otago Polytechnic policies. Students can view policies on the Otago Polytechnic website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Extensions}
Please familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, please contact your lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Students may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are completed within a short time frame (usually no more than 5 working days) and usually must be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to students who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be C-.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural and code-quality standards.
    \item Explain relevant principles of human perception and cognition and their importance to software design.
    \item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario and incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
