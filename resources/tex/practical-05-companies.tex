\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this assessment, you will research \& refactor the provided application's code so that you can switch between two \textbf{Google map} styles using a \textbf{menu} item. This assessment contributes \textbf{2\%} towards your final mark in \textbf{IN721: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement \& publish complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural \& code-quality standards.
	\item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario \& incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
	\item Follow industry standard software engineering practice in the design of mobile applications.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this individual assessment inside \& outside timetabled class time. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 07 May 2021} at \textbf{5:00 PM}. 

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{IN721: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment must be completely your work \& any references must be cited appropriately including, externally-sourced graphic elements. Provide your references in a \textbf{README.md} file. All media must be royalty free (or legally purchased) for educational use. Failure to do this will result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions \& Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions \& resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submissions}
You must submit all program files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission â€“ \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/VJIq7Ae0}{https://classroom.github.com/a/VJIq7Ae0}. Create a new branch called  \textbf{05-companies} from the \textbf{main} branch by running the command - \textbf{git checkout -b 05-companies}. This branch will be your development branch for this assessment. Once you have completed this assessment, create a pull request \& assign the \textbf{GitHub} user \textbf{grayson-orr} to a reviewer. \textbf{Do not} merge your own pull request. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame \& usually must be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity \& achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits \& reassessments are not applicable in \textbf{IN721: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Instructions - Learning Outcomes 2, 3}
\subsection*{Task One (2\%):}
Use \& rename the \textbf{google-maps-companies} directory from the \textbf{15-google-maps} teaching session to \textbf{05-companies}. \\

In \textbf{res $>$ raw}, you have been provided two \textbf{JSON} files called \textbf{map\_style\_dark.json} \& \textbf{map\_style\_retro.json}. These files contain feature, element \& styling data that you can apply to your \textbf{Google map}. If you wish to create your own style, refer to this link - \href{https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com}{https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com} \\

You may be prompt with a window asking you to try the cloud-based maps style wizard. For this assessment, the old style wizard is sufficient. \\

In the \textbf{onMapReady()} method, set the \textbf{Google map} style to \textbf{map\_style\_retro.json}. \\

Run your application on either an \textbf{Android Emulator} or \textbf{connect device}. \\

\includegraphics[width=5cm, height=9cm]{../../resources/img/practicals/05-companies-3.png} \\

In \textbf{MapsActivity.kt}, override the \textbf{onCreateOptionsMenu()} method. In this method, inflate your menu resource defined in \textbf{menu\_map\_style.xml} into the \textbf{Menu} provided in the callback. \\

Restart your application on either an \textbf{Android Emulator} or \textbf{connect device}. Click on the \textbf{vertical ellipsis} in the top-right hand corner of your screen. \\ 

\includegraphics[width=5cm, height=9cm]{../../resources/img/practicals/05-companies-4.png}  \\

Override the \textbf{onOptionsItemSelected()} method so that when you click on a menu item, i.e., \textbf{Change Map Style}, it switches between the retro \& dark \textbf{Google map} styles. \\

Restart your application on either an \textbf{Android Emulator} or \textbf{connect device}. Again, click on the \textbf{vertical ellipsis}, then \textbf{Change Map Style}. \\
