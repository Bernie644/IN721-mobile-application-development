# **Android Overview**

## Android Operating System
**Android** is a mobile os based on a modified version of the **Linux kernel** & primarily designed for touchscreen devices such as phones, tablets & watches. **Android** is developed by a group of developers known as the **Open Handset Alliance** or **OHA** & commercially sponsored by **Google**. Android is free & open-source, & its source code is known as **Android Open Source Project** or **AOSP**, which is licensed under the **Apache License**. Although, most Android devices are shipped with pre-installed proprietary software such as **Google Mobile Services**.

### Brief History
**Android Inc.** was founded in Palo Alto, CA, in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miller, Nick Sears & Chris White. The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced os for digital cameras. The company then decided that the market for digital cameras was not large enough. They later pivoted, & pitched Android to investors as a handset os that would compete against **Symbian** & **Windows Mobile** (both discontinued). In July 2005, **Google** acquired **Android Inc.** for around $50 million. Key employees, including Rubin, Miller, Sears & White, joined Google as part of the acquisition. 

At Google, Rubin & his team developed a mobile device platform powered by the **Linux kernel**. Google marketed the platform to handset providers & carriers on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradeable system. In 2006, **Google's** plans to enter the mobile communications market continued. An early prototype closely resembled a **BlackBerry** phone which had a QWERTY keyboard & no touchscreen. With the unveiling of the **Apple iPhone** in 2007 meant **Android** had to go back to the drawing board. In 2008, both **Nokia** & **BlackBerry** announced touch-based smartphones that to rival the **iPhone 3G**. Subsequently, **Android** switch their focus to touchscreens. The first commercially available smartphone running **Android** was the **HTC Dream** which was announced in September 2008.
